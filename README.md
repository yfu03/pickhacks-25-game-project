## PickHacks 2025 Submission: Minibomb
### Description
Minibomb is a top-down minigolf game with a unique spin! You're able to place a bomb during the round that pushes your ball, as well as breaks destructible terrain!

It was made over a 36 hour period as a submission for Missouri University of Science and Technology's PickHacks 2025 Hackathon.

### Controls
- Click and drag on the golf ball to aim and control the power of your putt!
- Press Q to go into bomb placing mode. Left click to place the bomb at your mouse cursor.
- Press Q again after the bomb has been placed to make it explode! You can do this before or during a putt.
- Press R to restart the current level.
